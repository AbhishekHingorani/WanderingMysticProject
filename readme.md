# Wandering Mystic

Wandering Mystic is a e-commerce app, which also allows users to search and review tours and travel packages and inquire about the same.

The objective of the project is to provide ease of access to browse tour packages and buying of geo-specific products for the customers. To achieve that, we have to develop a website to support admin functionalities and an e-commerce App for selling goods as well as displaying the tour packages so that customers can inquire about them.
